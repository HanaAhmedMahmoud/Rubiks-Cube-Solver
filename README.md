# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
This is the first project I completed for my computer science A-Level NEA where I used C sharp, visual studious and blazer to implement a model of a Rubiks Cube and used OOP techniques to create a solver. Attached to this should be my written solution; I am more than happy to answer any queries if you have any.
